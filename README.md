Extra Code Practice
===============

Code solutions for various practice questions I get asked, or just things I find online.
The focus here is "quick-and-dirty". While better solutions exist, I want to be simplistic in nature and powerful by design.
My focus in languages will be Bash and web-based languages - JavaScript (jQuery) and PHP, with possibly some HTML/CSS if it's a design challenge as well.

Never assume the solutions posted here are "correct" and "complete", or "optimal" in any sense of the word. I created this repository to have a "learning platform" on the cloud for which I could stage my processes. Hopefully this way I can actually get "noticed" for teaching myself to code via external sources (class can only teach so much...), and possibly get a development job? I think I have the mind for it, but I definitely need to patch up on the mechanical skill, which is what this is for! :)

I may stop updating this sometime in the near future, depending on how little or how much I get done. I'll be doing my best to "continue doing stuff here" until well after I retire, but we'll see how lazy I get in the meanwhile, especially with school and interviews rampaging all around me.
